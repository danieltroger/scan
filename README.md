scan
====

Command line scanning utility for hp printers (tested with hp photosmart 7510).

Has the ability to scan multiple pages to a pdf or one to a jpg with loads of options.
The PDF's are readable by evertything as far is I know, they are done with FPDF and not HP's bullshit on the printer.

ADF is not yet supported since i haven't figured out how to decode the buggy PDF's.
All i have got are small images with more than three times the page size filled of black which are only readable and openable with Apple's image viewer and crashes imagemagick and php gd.
